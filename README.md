# **Hi there! Nice to meet you 👋**

I am EggFine 🌟, and I'm from Fuyang city in Anhui province, China 🇨🇳. My programming journey began at the age of 7 when I started learning Easy Programming Language and working on development projects 👨‍💻. As I delved deeper into my studies, I gradually mastered a wider range of skills, including video editing with Premiere Pro 🎬, graphic design using CorelDRAW 🎨, and system operations and maintenance 🖥️.

Throughout my learning and professional development, I've been fortunate to achieve several notable accomplishments 🏆:

- 🥇 First place and first-class award in the Fuyang "Fu Chuang Hui" Vocational School Skills Competition for two consecutive years (2020-2021 and 2022-2023)
- 🏅 9th place in the Anhui Province selection for the 2022 BRICS and Belt and Road Initiative Vocational Skills Competition (Information Security)
- 🥇 First place and first-class award in the 2022-2023 Anhui Province "Bank of China Cup" Vocational School Skills Competition
- 🥇 First place in the 2023 China Skills Anhui Province selection competition
- 🥈 Second-class award in the 2023 China Skills national competition

Beyond my professional skills, I have numerous personal interests 🎮. I'm passionate about Minecraft ⛏️ and enjoy other single-player games like Arknights 🎭 and Cyberpunk 2077 🌆. These games not only provide entertainment but also inspire my creativity and technical innovation 💡.

Currently, I'm focusing on developing plugins for Minecraft 🧩, primarily based on the Spigot and Folia APIs. If you're interested in my work, feel free to check out my projects on the SpigotMC platform 🔍.

I firmly believe that technology has the power to change the world 🌍, and I hope to contribute to this ever-evolving digital landscape through continuous learning and innovation 🚀.
